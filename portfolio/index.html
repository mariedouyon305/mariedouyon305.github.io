							About Me

					</h2>
					<p>
						Hi there and thanks for making your way here. Quick over view about me, Im 28 years old and have been working in the tech field for the last 4 years. Ive lived in New York city since I was seventeen years old. But orginally my parents and I are from Port Au Prince, Haiti (YES I do speak creole :)) but grew up mainly in Miami, Florida. When I became a teenager I had the opportunity to move back to Haiti and so I spent two years living in Les Cayes ( pronounced Aux Cayes in Creole), Haiti. When my family moved back to the states, they chose Queens, New York City. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Orginally when I started working I started off as a Certified Nursing Assistant working in hospitals, Nursing homes and other health related companies. One day I noticed that patient charts, labs, and daily information was being stored electronically instead of on paper. So from there I was referred by my Fairy God Mother (YES they do EXIST) to obtain basic technical training from PerScholas Technology Inc. And became a Comptia A +, Network +, Mobility + certified technician in 2014.

								Past Experiences

						</h2> 
						<p>
							Also the last four years of my technical career has consisted of hands on, helpdesk (a lot of customer service exposure) experience working with outsourced companies (Staffmark, Teksystems, NitHealth) for health care facilites (Health and Hospital Coporation - Bellevue NYC, Hackensack NJ, Catskills NJ). So from working with Epic/Quadramed to understanding SLA's (internal and external workflows)to undertsanding how to use ticketing systems (Remedy, CRM, or ServiceNow). 
						</p>

						<p> 
							The journey up until learning to code has been interesting. But the exposure to using Epic/Quadramed, really pushed me to pursue coding. Most of my experience came from my own curiosity using free platforms online (coursera, edx, freeCodeAcademy, treeHouse). But the exposure to EMRs like Epic really put things into was the push I need. And once again the fairy god mother advised TechHire to help with me transition from my techincal understanding to a developer.
